# floating_fullscreen_widget

It is easy to lose a sense of time when using programs or games on fullscreen.
This application runs in the background and will show a floating widget whenever you are going fullscreen. This simple widget will show the current time and your battery status to keep you up-to-date, while not interrupting your work or gaming session!

The app can be easily controlled with a tray icon and a settings panel.

This app is powered by Flutter and works with WindowsAPI.

## Key Features

* Whitelisting windows to show the widget in
